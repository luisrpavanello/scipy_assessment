## Implementation of round() for sparse matrices

- Added `__round__` method to `scipy/sparse/data.py`
- Implemented support for `decimals` parameter
- Added comprehensive tests verifying:
- Basic rounding
- Different decimal places
- Empty matrices
- Integer matrices

## Development Process

1. **Initial Analysis**:
- I identified that the `__round__` method was missing in sparse matrices
- I checked the similar implementation of `__abs__` as a reference

2. **Development**:
- I implemented it in `scipy/sparse/data.py`:
```python
def __round__(self, decimals=0):
return self._with_data(np.round(self.data, decimals=decimals))
```
- I added handling to `__getattr__` in `base.py` to map `.round()` to `__round__`

3. **Tests**:
- I created 4 comprehensive tests in `test_round.py`:
- Basic rounding case
- Rounding with different decimal places
- Empty matrix
- Matrix with integer values

4. **Difficulties Encountered**:
- Initial issues with Docker and dependencies
- Need to modify both `data.py` and `base.py`
- Challenge of ensuring preservation of the sparse structure

5. **Final Solution**:
- Complete and robust implementation
- All tests passing
